I'm software engineer, entrepreneur, published academic and conference speaker. I have a keen interest in the 
relationship people have with technology, how software can help improve people's lives and benefit society. Technology 
and software should be built for the benefit of society. With my passion for building software and my insight into 
business operations, processes and practice, I work with organisations to help them get the most out of technology, 
build great products, achieve their goals and become more effective.
